# Common Test Data for the Bouncy Castle Crypto Packages

With the arrival of post-quantum algorithms the size of the test data for the Bouncy Castle projects has increased dramatically and it's only likely to get worse as more algorithms are evaluated and the final standards start to come on-line.

This repostory contains the test data files that are common across the Bouncy Castle projects. You'll need to have this repository cloned along side the Java or C# clone you are using in order to get all the tests to run.
